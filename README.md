## Notes:
  I highly recommend using the Sparkfun/Adafruit repositories for their respective
  devices and components. They are not all beginner friendly, but are excellent
  resources for learning how to setup and use their devices.
  
  You have the option of connecting a thermocouple to the breakout using another method
  that fits your needs better. The '+' and '-' throughholes of interest are indicated
  on the breakout.
